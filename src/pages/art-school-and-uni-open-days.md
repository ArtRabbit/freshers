We hear a lot of parents (our own included) telling their kids that they should study something practical, because gaining the skills to be able to afford rent is highly valuable. But practicality shouldn’t be so narrow a gradient. Before you decide to take on the journey of becoming a techno-serf or follow the lucrative path of a business admin, know your options and the array of possible careers that come with each potential degree. If you love art, and if you feel that creativity is something you can capitalise on in order to forge your own way, you owe it to yourself to explore the programmes catered to individuals just like you. We’ve collated all the upcoming open days at UK art schools and universities in below spreadsheet. Feel free to make a copy and share with your friends.
