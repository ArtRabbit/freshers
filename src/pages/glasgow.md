## by Centre of Contemporary Arts (CCA)

Considered a national cultural hub, Glasgow is known for its iconic art nouveau architecture, thriving art scene, and some of the friendliest people you'll meet. Alongside several significant contemporary art organisations and institutions, the wider cultural climate (which includes theatre, dance, opera, live music and more) adds to the richness of its artistic environment. 

Among the organisations vital to the lifeblood of Glasgow’s cultural scene is the [Centre for Contemporary Arts](https://www.artrabbit.com/organisations/centre-for-contemporary-arts-cca-glasgow), Glasgow’s hub for the arts. Their year-round programme includes exhibitions, film, music, literature, spoken word, workshops, festivals, Gaelic and performance. At the heart of all activities is the desire to work with artists, commission new projects and present them to the widest possible audience. Their activities extend across the city through their public engagement programme, which has – at its heart – the prospect of social and cultural change explored through art. In addition to the array of activities and events offered, the CCA is home to two wonderful shops - Aye-Aye Books and Welcome Home - as well as the Saramago Cafe Bar.

Below you’ll find a list of art-related places to see and events to attend from across Glasgow, as curated by Julie Cathcart, Communications Manager of CCA.
