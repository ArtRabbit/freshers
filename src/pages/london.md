## by ArtRabbit

Does London even need an introduction? It probably does, and any assumption that it doesn't probably contributed to this whole Brexit situation. That's not to downplay the British capital in its cultural significance, for it is undeniable that both nationally and internationally, London is a leading force within contemporary art and visual culture. 

This might account for why ArtRabbit is based here. It's where we experience the most art, and it's where each of us at ArtRabbit fell in love with art, some for the first time and some for the millionth. And after all these years, London still never ceases to amaze us with its cultural offerings. We hope we can help you fall in love with art as well, and in so doing, love this city just a little more. 

## Art Trails

With London being an endlessly walkable city and so chock-full of inspiring art venues, we’ve created some art trails throughout London to get you acquainted with each neighbourhood. **We'll be launching a new London trail every week or two**, so be sure to watch this space to explore a new part of London through art on the regular. They’ve been meticulously field-tested, with each trail taking no more than an hour max (excluding time spent inside venues), so they’re guaranteed to be a perfect way to explore different parts of town.

The order of venues are only suggestions, so feel free to curate your own itinerary. While we wanted to highlight our favourite non-profit spaces and museums in this edition, there are lots more spaces and galleries nested in the different areas. For the most comprehensive gallery hopping experience, make sure to [download the ArtRabbit app](https://www.artrabbit.com/app).

## Freebies

One of the best things about art is that you can experience it freely no matter how little you have in your savings account. When you’re experienced enough, you’ll be able to organise your social calendar around the free refreshments at exhibition openings. Until then, use this freebies guide to find all the art that you can consume without costing you anything.

Most commercial galleries will have rotating exhibitions that change every few weeks/other month, and they’ll be free to attend. Depending on the particular gallery, exhibition openings tend to fall on Thursday and Friday evenings, and those are great times to network with like-minded individuals while sipping free drinks. Want to stay in the know? Be sure to subscribe to our[ location-specific weekly newsletters](https://www.artrabbit.com/subscribe) to get all the must-attend events near you beamed right to your inbox.

Project spaces tend to have artist-led initiatives rather than in-house curators. While the events that happen at such spaces vary in their scope, they’re largely free admission (or some by donation), and they house some spectacularly interesting projects that are experimental in nature.

Regular collections at several larger museums and galleries will often offer free admission, while their special exhibitions tend to have pricey entrance fees. Venues that fall under this camp are the Tate, the National Gallery and V&A.

Other freebies include public art, which is a great way to navigate through any city. The [City of London is home to an extensive collection](https://www.sculptureinthecity.org.uk/) of public artworks – from statues and memorials of historic significance to contemporary pieces by some of the world’s most renowned artists.

More fun freebies can be found with Tate Lates, happening the last Friday of every month at Tate Modern; at other less frequent times at Tate Britain; and Friday Late at the V&A, also happening every last Friday of every month (except May and December). With a perfect concoction of endless art and delicious cocktails, Lates are the perfect events to give a first date impression of being both cultured and fun.

## [V&A Friday Late](https://www.vam.ac.uk/info/friday-late)

If you prefer some (sort of) fresh city air over (wine-infused) artsy venues, Sculpture in the City is an annually rotating programme of sculptures scattered across London, each by internationally acclaimed artists. You can forge your own walking path from one to the next to create a make-your-own-art-adventure type of game.
