## by Centre for Chinese Contemporary Arts (CFCCA)

Manchester is well known for the number of musical giants that emerged from their thriving music scene, with significant names including Oasis, the Smiths, Joy Division, the Stone Roses, The Chemical Brothers and countless others. Besides its ability to nurture musical talent, Manchester sees a variety of organisations that support contemporary art by providing space and opportunities to artists and art lovers alike.

One such organisation that boasts a consistently interesting programme of events and exhibitions is the [Centre for Chinese Contemporary Art](https://www.artrabbit.com/organisations/cfcca-centre-for-chinese-contemporary-art). CFCCA is unique as it is the national leader in bringing Chinese contemporary art and visual culture to a UK audience. For over 30 years, CFCCA has led the UK in showcasing artists from China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and the diaspora, through a rich programme of exhibitions, events, residencies and collaborations.

Here are some indispensable cultural staples from around Manchester, selected by Peggy Manning from CFCCA.
