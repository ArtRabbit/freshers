From early May until late September, art and design schools from across the UK host graduate shows presenting the work of their final year students. These exhibitions are a culmination of all the hard work that students put into their studies throughout their time at uni, and it’s from this that galleries and collectors find their next generation of talent. As art students, attending as many degree shows as you can is the best way to see what other talents are being harvested - and what you’re up against.

Every year, in support of art students everywhere, we publish a [Degree Show Feature](https://www.artrabbit.com/events/uk-degree-shows-2019) that highlights all the exhibitions happening across the UK. Be sure to keep an eye out for it, and by the time it’s your year, you’ll be well-informed to put your best work forward.

If you’re a part of or organising a show, regardless of the stage of your academic journey, be sure to list it on ArtRabbit. It’s the best way to promote yourself as a budding artist, and it’s absolutely free to do. List your show on ArtRabbit to be featured on our website, newsletters and app.
