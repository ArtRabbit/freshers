## by Dundee Contemporary Arts

Dundee, located in the eastern central lowlands of Scotland, was historically known for three things: Jute, Jam and Journalism. While the jute trade may have died down, jam and journalism are still going strong, and the city has added many cultural gems over the years, plus it's the UK's first (and only) UNESCO City of Design.

Of particular significance to the arts in the Scottish lowlands is Dundee Contemporary Arts (DCA). Located in the heart of the city, DCA is an internationally renowned centre for contemporary art that enables audiences, artists and participants to see, experience and create. They house two beautiful large-scale gallery spaces, two thriving cinema screens, a busy print studio, an award-winning learning programme, and a packed programme of events, workshops, classes and activities. 2019 marks our 20th birthday and we’re spending the whole year celebrating with special events, film screenings and more.

Below are the cultural gems to be found throughout Dundee, as chosen by Helen Macdonald, Communications Coordinator at DCA.

## Art Trail

[DCA Galleries](https://www.artrabbit.com/organisations/dundee-contemporary-arts)

What can we say, we’d love it if you started your Art Trail at DCA! From Sat 14 September – Sun 24 November you can see How Flexible Can We Make the Mouth, the first major UK solo exhibition of Barbadian-Scottish artist Alberta Whittle which draws together new and recent artworks in film, sculpture, print, installation and performance. 

[V&A Dundee](https://www.artrabbit.com/organisations/va-dundee)

Scotland’s first dedicated design museum and the first V&A museum outside of London, V&A Dundee is easy to spot sitting on the bank of the Tay. Designed by architect Kengo Kuma, the building houses changing exhibitions (their next exhibition, Hello, Robot. starts Sat 2 November), a gallery space full of Scottish design, a shop, restaurant and more. 

[RSS Discovery](https://www.artrabbit.com/organisations/rrs-discovery)

Right next door to V&A Dundee is the iconic ship RSS Discovery. Discovery Point tells the story of the ship, from its beginnings in Dundee to Captain Scott’s Antarctic expedition and beyond. There are galleries to explore, video and film shows to watch, plus the chance to step onboard this historic vessel.

[The McManus: Dundee’s Art Gallery and Museum](https://www.artrabbit.com/organisations/the-mcmanus-dundees-art-gallery-and-museum)

Walking back into the city you’ll find The McManus, Dundee’s Art Gallery and Museum. Offering a fascinating insight into the history of the city, The McManus houses a whopping eight different galleries in one stunning building. Inside you can find exhibits ranging from the life of early man right up to Dundee’s recent history (hello Lemmings!), as well as paintings and artworks from 1750 onwards, plus touring exhibitions.

[Cooper Gallery](https://www.artrabbit.com/organisations/cooper-gallery)

Part of the University of Dundee, Exhibitions at Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design (DJCAD) fill four gallery spaces with exhibitions by national and international artists, designers, writers and creative thinkers. Cooper Gallery is their premier space, hosting four major shows a year as well as housing parts of the DJCAD Degree and Masters shows.

[Generator Projects](https://www.artrabbit.com/organisations/generator-projects)

Tucked away just off Perth Road a little further up from Cooper Gallery is Generator Projects. Generator is an artist-run project and exhibition space that works with local and national artists, providing a varied programme of exhibitions and events. With their annual Members’ Show and They Had 4 Years, an exhibition showcasing work by recent graduates, plus a whole host of different projects throughout the year, there’s always something exciting going on.

[Dundee Rep Theatre](https://www.artrabbit.com/organisations/dundee-rep-theatre)

Just down the road from DCA, Dundee Rep and Scottish Dance Theatre are housed in a purpose-built art space where they create and deliver a diverse programme of theatre and dance productions as well as welcoming a whole host of visiting productions including theatre, music, comedy and family shows.
