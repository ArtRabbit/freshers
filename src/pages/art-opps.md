There are also some valuable perennial competitions that every aspiring artist should have on their radar. Entering in these competitions is an excellent way to gain experience, to build your CV, to network and gain access to valuable mentoring, and to earn money in order to pursue more ambitious projects. Most of these competitions are free to enter, and they are reputable within the industry, offering a good return for the amount of time it takes to submit work. While you’re free to apply to whichever open call tickles your fancy, we would always suggest that you make sure the organisations you’re applying to are reputable, and it’s always better if they’re free.

One such competition that is worth checking out is [Bloomberg New Contemporaries](https://www.newcontemporaries.org.uk/). Although it requires a £25 application fee, this 70 years old organisation has foretold the brilliant careers of some of the UK’s most celebrated artists. The [Frieze Artist Award](https://frieze.com/tags/frieze-artist-award) is also one to look out for. This international open call is for an artist aged between 25 and 40 to realise a site-specific work at Frieze London with a £20,000 production budget. The [Future Generation Art Prize](https://futuregenerationartprize.org/) is a biannual prize that awards US$100,000 to its winner, open to all artists around the world aged 35 or younger. For those working in sculpture and painting, the [Woon Foundation Prize](https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/about-us/news-events/news/woon-prize/) offers studio space and £20,000 to its winner, open to final year Fine Art students.
