[Own Art](https://www.ownart.org.uk/) is an Arts Council funded initiative, run by Creative United, designed to make it easy and affordable for everyone to own high-quality contemporary art and craft by providing interest-free loans. Choose the artwork you love, apply for a loan from as little as £100 up to £25,000, and pay it back over 10 or 20 months, completely interest-free.
