Arts Council in [England](https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/), [Scotland](https://www.creativescotland.com/), [Wales](https://arts.wales/) and [Northern Ireland](http://www.artscouncil-ni.org/) are some of the biggest funders of arts and culture projects in the nation, with regular investments in shows, spaces and programmes for a lasting return. Their mission is to ensure that there is great art for everyone available in their respective regions, and they do this not only by providing funding but also by offering guidance, resources and acting as a development agency.
