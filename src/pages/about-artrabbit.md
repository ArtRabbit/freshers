We hope you enjoyed this year’s edition 

ArtRabbit is an independent digital art platform for serendipitous art discovery. We provide a crowd-sourced database of contemporary art events, publish weekly newsletters, an app, and other digital resources to help you navigate the uneven terrain of contemporary and visual culture.



Our Art Freshers Web Book was created to provide a useful, accessible resource for those just starting out in the UK as an art student (or anyone new to the scene). The Book was created and written by the ArtRabbit team in collaboration with some of the best arts organisations in the UK and beyond, including Artes Mundi, Centre for Contemporary Arts Glasgow, CFCCA Manchester, Dundee Contemporary Arts, The Edge, IKON, Jupiter Artland, OUTPUT Gallery, Peacock Visual Arts, Phoenix Art Space, Spike Island, and The Tetley, without whom we couldn’t have created such a comprehensive guide.
