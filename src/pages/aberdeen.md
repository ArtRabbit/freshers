## by Peacock Visual Arts

The flat grey slabs of the Granite City have long been awash in the oil industry that led to its economic boom of recent decades. But while the Earth is burning and the oil reserves of the North Sea decrease, Aberdeen has been turning its efforts towards other sources of energy while exercising a rebrand for its image as something other than the home of Big Oil shrugging in nonchalance. Part of this rebrand has seen money being allocated towards the arts, which has led to the inauguration of several cultural organisations and art festivals in the city.

Yet long before this turn towards culture was made, [Peacock Visual Arts](https://www.artrabbit.com/organisations/peacock-visual-arts) have been hosting incredible art events since 1974. [Peacock Visual Arts](https://www.artrabbit.com/organisations/peacock-visual-arts) has supported thousands of artists in the production of artworks since it opened its doors, ranging from prints to video works, photography, performance and site-specific public installations. At its core lies the idea of the multiple, work that can be reproduced in a variety of formats, analogue and digital, reconfiguring the relationship between the artist, the artwork and the audience, which can be outlined simply as – making, learning and showing. Their organisation is supported by Aberdeen City Council and Creative Scotland.

Peacock’s role in the city of Aberdeen, through its printmaking department, digital studio and gallery/project space [The W OR M](https://www.artrabbit.com/organisations/the-w-or-m), has been to activate spaces where artists and the citizens, prompted by artworks, congregate around ideas and practices that interrupt everyday routines. Their making facilities include a digital fabrication studio, screen printing studio and relief printing studio.

In their print shop, they have a wide range of contemporary art prints for sale by local, regional and international artists, many of which have been published and editioned at Peacock Visual Arts.

Beyond Peacock’s seminal role in Aberdeen, the following are some staples to the Aberdeen cultural milieu, selected by Neil Corall, Marketing Manager & Digital Studio Manager, and Joe Coleman, General Manager at Peacock Visual Arts.

## Art Trail

[Aberdeen Art Gallery](https://www.artrabbit.com/organisations/aberdeen-art-gallery)

Opened in 1885 and regarded as one of the best Art Galleries in Britain It's been closed since 2015 but sets to re-open this November after a £34 million redevelopment. A great place in the city centre to while away a few hours with the added bonus of a nice cafe and host to world-class touring exhibitions.

[Maritime Museum](https://www.artrabbit.com/organisations/aberdeen-maritime-museum)

Before Aberdeen was known as the Oil Capital of Europe it had a rich history within shipbuilding as well as fishing. The Maritime Museum manages to tell the stories of these chapters of Aberdeen History in an interesting and informative manner in a handy city centre location. Fun fact: the clipper ship built in Aberdeen "The Thermopylae" still holds the record for the fastest trip under sail on its maiden voyage to Melbourne in 1872.

[Tolbooth Museum](https://www.artrabbit.com/organisations/the-tolbooth-museum)

Situated in a former jail and in one of Aberdeen's oldest buildings, The Tolbooth Museum is located on Union Street so couldn't be any more central and is brimming with history and artefacts of the darker side of Aberdeen. It also claims to be one of Aberdeen's most haunted buildings.

[Anatomy Rooms](https://www.artrabbit.com/organisations/the-anatomy-rooms)

They describe themselves as "a multi-arts production and studio space" and are housed in the former Anatomy Department of the University of Aberdeen. They are a great destination for small independent shows as well as a much needed open studio space for makers and artists. They also host the odd gig or two and are worth visiting just to see the building they're in. Tucked around the back of Marischal College they are right bang in the city centre.

[Kekun Studio](https://www.artrabbit.com/organisations/kekun-studio)

Run by local stalwarts of the Aberdeen art scene Jon Reid and Mary Butterworth, Kekun Studio is a great independent gallery space which supports and hosts work by emerging within the city. They also do a good programme of workshops and events. Still central but slightly out of the city centre their small home in Rosemount is well worth a visit.

[Parx Cafe](https://www.artrabbit.com/organisations/parx-cafe)

A nice independent cafe space at the start of the West End of Aberdeen, their food selection is always top-notch and they offer a much-needed gallery space showcasing local arts and crafts as well as having an open call system for shows. Worth taking a walk to.

## Freebies

[Nuart City Tours](https://2019.nuartaberdeen.co.uk/)

Aberdeen has laid host to the Nuart street art festival for the last 3 years and as a result, has a wealth of street art in the city centre. This is easily discoverable by walking around but there are also scheduled tours and maps to help you navigate all the spots.

Painted Doors

Another great way to take in some free art in the city centre is Mary Butterworth's Painted Doors project. Encompassing work from 40+ Aberdeen based artists all spread, funnily enough on painted doors around the city centre. There's a map and a guide available to help navigate your way around.

[Legal Wall at Transition Xtreme](https://transition-extreme.com/)

A ten-minute walk from the city centre in the Transition Xtreme sports centre. This wall is free for any member of the public to use and offers a platform to express or practice some graffiti skills.

[Arches at Union Terrace Gardens](https://www.visitabdn.com/listing/union-terrace-gardens)

Not strictly part of the Nuart street art tour but a notable mention nonetheless, the arches in the central Union Terrace Gardens are well worth a look for some world-class graffiti.

## Sweet Study Spots

Can be busy at lunchtimes but outwith that it offers a great relaxed environment to work inside or outside in an interesting part of the city, tucked behind Union Street. Their food ain't too bad either.

[Richmond Street Deli](https://www.facebook.com/richmondstdeli)

If you’re up in the Rosemount area of the city this hidden gem is well worth a visit for a quiet place to work, unless it’s lunchtime and things can get a bit hectic. In our opinion, the best sandwich spot in the city, their daily specials are always fantastic and its Crispy Garlic Chicken Sandwich is top-notch.

[Brewdog](https://www.brewdog.com/bars/uk/brewdog-aberdeen/)

You've all heard of the worldwide phenomenon that is Brewdog but this is where it all began.

[Degrees North](https://www.sixdnorth.co.uk/aberdeen)

Another local success story in the craft beer world, 6 Degrees offers a very laid back place to work and socialise in with a mind-boggling selection of beers for when the work is done. Its location makes it very accessible for Aberdeen University students on their way into town.

[Food Story](http://foodstorycafe.co.uk/)

Situated off the West End of Union Street this award-winning quirky vegan-friendly cafe caters for all dietary requirements with a strong ethical mindset. They're open 8 til 9 almost every day and have plenty of tables to work at as well as free wi-fi. A very easy destination to spend a day.
