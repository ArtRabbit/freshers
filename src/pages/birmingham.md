## by Ikon

Representing the British Midlands is Birmingham, birthplace of the first practical steam engine and home to countless cultural and political movements. As the second-largest city in the UK, and with its history of both innovation and social mobility, it’s no wonder the Second City is brimming with so many contemporary art venues to visit and cultural programmes to experience. 

Among the organisations making Birmingham a cultural staple is [Ikon](https://www.artrabbit.com/organisations/ikon), an internationally acclaimed contemporary art venue situated in central Birmingham. Housed in a magnificent neo-gothic school building, it is an educational charity and works to encourage public engagement with contemporary art. The gallery programme features artists from around the world, as well as local talent. Ikon offers free entry to all.

The following are some noteworthy Birmingham art spaces, freebies and events, chosen by Sam Newman, Head of Development at Ikon. 

## Art Trail

A city-centre landmark, BMAG has over 40 galleries to explore, including a vast permanent collection and temporary exhibitions by the likes of Rachel Maclean and Capsule’s iconic Home of Metal exhibition. There’s also a stunning Edwardian Tea Room.
