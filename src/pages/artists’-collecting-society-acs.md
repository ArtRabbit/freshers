**Confused about your rights as an artist? ACS can help.** 

[The Artists' Collecting Society](https://artistscollectingsociety.org/about-acs/) (ACS) looks after a diverse range of over 1,000 artists for their intellectual property rights, including copyright and Artist’s Resale Right. 

Keeping up-and-coming artists informed as to how to protect their interests has always been a top priority for us. We have been educating emerging artists on their intellectual property rights through a series of talks and workshops designed to debunk the myths that surround copyright and the Artist's Resale Right since 2010. 

At the heart of what we do at ACS is the idea that artists should benefit from the work they create. Copyright and Artist’s Resale Right royalties provide invaluable financial support to artists at all stages of their careers. ACS ensures you receive the royalties that you are entitled to.

As a not-for-profit Community Interest Company, we are committed to supporting artists and reinvesting in the artistic community. We are proud to offer a range of different prizes and educational bursaries for emerging artists, such as our [residencies, materials prizes](https://artistscollectingsociety.org/prizes-bursaries/) and the annual [ACS Studio Prize](https://artistscollectingsociety.org/acs-studio-prize/). Since 2012, we have reinvested over £133,850 in financial support. 

[ACS members](https://artistscollectingsociety.org/members/) include seminal artists such as Lucian Freud, Barbara Hepworth, Frank Auerbach, Paula Rego, Gavin Turk and Maggi Hambling, as well as burgeoning artists such as Leonor Antunes, Pablo Bronstein and Flora Yukhnovich.  

Are you unsure about your copyright? Would you like to learn about how you can protect and market your work? Would your university benefit from an ACS talk on artists’ rights? [Get in touch!](https://artistscollectingsociety.org/contact/)
