## by Jupiter Artland

With its handsome medieval buildings and towering hills, the capital of Scotland makes for the perfect setting to nurture artistic inspiration. Though more known for its theatre arts and comedy festivals, Edinburgh has an established network of contemporary art organisations that are significant to the arts of the UK as a whole. One such organisation that has a claim to this accolade is Jupiter Artland.

Situated just outside Edinburgh, Jupiter Artland is a contemporary sculpture garden set in over 100 acres of meadow and woodland with a growing collection of permanent site-specific sculptures from artists including Phyllida Barlow, Christian Boltanski, Anish Kapoor, Cornelia Parker and Antony Gormley. Every year Jupiter present exhibitions across 5 indoor gallery spaces alongside an exciting seasonal programme of events, including Jupiter Rising, a weekend festival of art and performance within the landscape. Jupiter is open from the beginning of May to the end of September each year and easily accessed by bus from Edinburgh City Centre.

Below are a few of the best art spots in and around Edinburgh, as selected by Will Carey, Arts Administration Assistant at Jupiter Artland.
