A few hours out of every week is dedicated to some so-bad-that-it’s-good guilty pleasures. The rest of the time, your brain may be screaming for some stimulation (but not the headache-inducing type of stimulation like trying to decipher what those French philosophers are trying to say in their texts). We’ve come across some spectacular art films and documentaries in our travels that we think are both entertaining and enriching, especially for art students.

## Documentaries

**Abstract - The Art of Design, USA, 2019/2017**

Now in its second season, this Netflix documentary series highlights some of the most innovative designers currently on the world’s radar. Art and design are at times mutually exclusive (who needs function when you’ve got form?) but as it so happens, some of this season’s designers are also practising artists (among other disciplines such as typographers, toy designers and more). On the art front, Olafur Eliasson takes the screen with a feature on his innovative and groundbreaking approach to nature and art, while the spotlight falls on Neri Oxman and her creative practice that conflates technology with biology.
